A group of people are on a train for a tourism ad shoot, and one of them, Roger, keeps insisting on comedy even though it's not supposed to be funny. They end up on the wrong train, and panic sets in when they realize they don't have their phones and they can't stop the train. However, they eventually realize they are on the right train and enjoy the rest of the trip, with Trevor Noah even making an appearance and the group nearly missing their destination.
